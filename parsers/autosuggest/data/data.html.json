It indicates the link target, either a URL or a URL fragment, that is a name preceded by a hash mark (#), which specifies an internal target location (an ID) within the current document. URLs are not restricted to Web (HTTP)-based documents. URLs might use any protocol supported by the browser. For example, file, ftp, and mailto work in most user agents.  Note: You can use the special fragment &quot;top&quot; to create a link back to the top of the page; for example &lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Return to top&lt;\/a&gt;. This behavior is specified by HTML5.  \n\n \n\nhreflang This attribute indicates the language of the linked resource. It is purely advisory Allowed values are determined by BCP47 for HTML5 and by RFC1766 for HTML4. Use this attribute only if the \n\nhref\n attribute is present. \n\nmedia \nHTML5 This attribute specifies the media which the linked resource applies to. Its value must be a media query. This attribute is mainly useful when linking to external stylesheets by allowing the user agent to pick the best adapted one for the device it runs on.  Usage note:  In HTML 4, only simple white-space-separated list of media description literals, i.e. media types and groups, where defined and allowed as values for this attribute, like print, screen, aural, braille, ... HTML 5 extended this to any kind of media queries, which are a superset of the allowed values of HTML 4. Browsers not supporting the CSS3 Media Queries won't necessary recognized the adequate link; do not forget to set fallback links, the restricted set of media queries defined in HTML 4.   \n\n \n\nmethods Non-standard      \nUnimplemented\n The value of this attribute provides information about the functions that might be performed on an object. The values generally are given by the HTTP protocol when it is used, but it might (for similar reasons as for the title attribute) be useful to include advisory information in advance in the link. For example, the browser might choose a different rendering of a link as a function of the methods specified; something that is searchable might get a different icon, or an outside link might render with an indication of leaving the current site. This attribute is not well understood nor supported, even by the defining browser, Internet Explorer 4. Methods Property (MSDN) \n\nname \nHTML 4 only, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 This attribute is required in an anchor defining a target location within a page. A value for name is similar to a value for the id core attribute and should be an alphanumeric identifier unique to the document. Under the HTML 4.01 specification, id and name both can be used with the &lt;a&gt; element as long as they have identical values.  Usage note:&nbsp; This attribute is obsolete in HTML5, use global attribute id instead.  \n\n \n\nping \nHTML5 \nNew in Firefox 3\n \n\nbug 415168\n The support for &quot;ping&quot; was disabled starting with Firefox 3 beta 3.\n\n \n\nrel For anchors containing the href attribute, this attribute specifies the relationship of the target object to the link object. The value is a comma-separated list of relationship values. The values and their semantics will be registered by some authority that might have meaning to the document author. The default relationship, if no other is given, is void. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.\n\n \n\nrev \nHTML 4 only, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 This attribute specifies a reverse link, the inverse relationship of the rel attribute. It is useful for indicating where an object came from, such as the author of a document.\n\nNote: It is advisable to use the usemap attribute for the &lt;img&gt;\n element and the associated &lt;map&gt;\n element to define hotspots instead of the shape attribute.\n \n\nshape \nHTML 4 only, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 This attribute is used to define a selectable region for hypertext source links associated with a figure to create an image map. The values for the attribute are circle, default, polygon, and rect. The format of the coords attribute depends on the value of shape. For circle, the value is x,y,r where x and y are the pixel coordinates for the center of the circle and r is the radius value in pixels. For rect, the coords attribute should be x,y,w,h. The x,y values define the upper-left-hand corner of the rectangle, while w and h define the width and height respectively. A value of polygon for shape requires x1,y1,x2,y2,... values for coords. Each of the x,y pairs defines a point in the polygon, with successive points being joined by straight lines and the last point joined to the first. The value default for shape requires that the entire enclosed area, typically an image, be used.\n\n \n\ntarget This attribute specifies where to display the linked resource. In HTML4, this is the name of, or a keyword for, a frame. In HTML5, it is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). The following keywords have special meanings:  _self:&nbsp;Load the response into the same HTML4 frame (or HTML5 browsing context) as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed HTML4 window or HTML5 browsing context. _parent:&nbsp;Load the response into the HTML4 frameset parent of the current frame or HTML5 parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self. _top: In HTML4: Load the response into the full, original window, canceling all other frames. In HTML5: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.  Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.\n\n \n\ntype This attribute specifies the media type in the form of a MIME type for the link target. Generally, this is provided strictly as advisory information; however, in the future a browser might add a small icon for multimedia types. For example, a browser might add a small speaker icon when type is set to audio\/wav. For a complete list of recognized MIME types, see http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html4\/references.html#ref-MIMETYPES. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.\n\n \n\nurnNon-standard      \nUnimplemented\n This supposedly Microsoft-supported attribute relates a uniform resource name (URN) with the link. While it is based on standards work years back, the meaning of URNs is still not well defined, so this attribute is meaningless. urn Property (MSDN)\n\nDOM&nbsp;Interface\nThis element implements the HTMLAnchorElement interface.\nExample\n\r\n          &lt;!-- anchor linking to external file --&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.mozilla.com\/&quot;&gt;\nExternal Link\n&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n        \nResult\nExternal Link\nResult\nExternal Link\nBrowser compatibility\n\n\n\n Desktop Mobile\n\n\n    Feature Chrome Firefox (Gecko) Internet Explorer Opera Safari   Basic support (Supported) 1.0 (1.7 or earlier)\n (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)   href=&quot;#top&quot; (Supported) 10.0 (10.0)\n (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)   \n\n    Feature Android Firefox Mobile (Gecko) IE Mobile Opera Mobile Safari Mobile   Basic support (Supported) 1.0 (1.0)\n (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)   href=&quot;#top&quot; (Supported) 10.0 (10.0)\n (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)   \n\nNotes\nThe following are reserved browser key bindings for the two major browsers and should not be used as values to accesskey: a, c, e, f, g, h, v, left arrow, and right arrow.\nHTML 3.2 defines only name, href, rel, rev, and title.\nThe target attribute is not defined in browsers that do not support frames, such as Netscape 1 generation browsers. Furthermore, target is not allowed under strict variants of XHTML but is limited to frameset or transitional forms.\nJavaScript recommendations\nIt is often the case that an anchor tag is used with the onclick event. In order to prevent the page from refreshing, href is often set to either &quot;#&quot; or &quot;javascript:void(0)&quot;. Both of these values can lead to some unexpected errors when copying links and opening links in a new tab and\/or window. Be aware of this for usability reasons, and when users do use anchor tags and you prevent default behavior.\n\n   HTML Elements   A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z   (Quick Links: HTML Category)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript recommendations\nIt is often the case that an anchor tag is used with the onclick event.

If not specified, the default is the base URI of the current document. \n\ncodetype \nHTML 4 only; \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 The content type of the data specified by classid. \n\ndata The address of the resource as a valid URL. At least one of data and type must be defined. \n\ndeclare \nHTML 4 only; \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 The presence of this Boolean attribute makes this element a declaration only. The object must be instantiated by a subsequent &lt;object&gt; element. In HTML5, repeat the &lt;object&gt; element completely each that that the resource is reused. \n\nform \nHTML5 The form element, if any, that the object element is associated with (its form owner). The value of the attribute must be an ID of a &lt;form&gt;\n element in the same document. \n\nheight The height of the displayed resource, in CSS&nbsp;pixels. \n\nname The name of valid browsing context (HTML5), or the name of the control (HTML 4). \n\nstandby \nHTML 4 only; \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 A message that the browser can show while loading the object's implementation and data. \n\ntabindex \nHTML 4 only; \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 The position of the element in the tabbing navigation order for the current document. \n\ntype The MIME&nbsp;type of the resource specified by data.

Permitted parent elements Any element that accepts phrasing content. The &lt;area&gt; element must have an ancestor &lt;map&gt;\n, but it need not be a direct parent.   Normative documents HTML 5, section 4.8.13; HTML 4.01, section 13.6.1  \n\nAttributes\nLike all other HTML elements, this element supports the global attributes.\n \n\naccesskey \nHTML 4 only, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 Specifies a keyboard navigation accelerator for the element. Pressing ALT or a similar key in association with the specified character selects the form control correlated with that key sequence. Page designers are forewarned to avoid key sequences already bound to browsers. This attribute is global since HTML5.\n\n \n\nalt A text string alternative to display on browsers that do not display images. The text should be phrased so that it presents the user with the same kind of choice as the image would offer when displayed without the alternative text. In HTML4, this attribute is required, but may be the empty string (&quot;&quot;). In HTML5, this attribute is required only if the href attribute is used.\n\n \n\ncoords A set of values specifying the coordinates of the hot-spot region. The number and meaning of the values depend upon the value specified for the shape attribute. For a rect or rectangle shape, the coords value is two x,y pairs: left, top, right, and bottom. For a circle shape, the value is x,y,r where x,y is a pair specifying the center of the circle and r is a value for the radius. For a poly or polygon&lt; shape, the value is a set of x,y pairs for each point in the polygon: x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3, and so on. In HTML4, the values are numbers of pixels or percentages, if a percent sign (%) is appended; in HTML5, the values are numbers of CSS&nbsp;pixels.\n\n \n\nhref The hyperlink target for the area. Its value is a valid URL. In HTML4, either this attribute or the nohref attribute must be present in the element. In HTML5, this attribute may be omitted; if so, the area element does not represent a hyperlink.\n\n \n\nhreflang \nHTML5 Indicates the language of the linked resource. Allowed values are determined by BCP47. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.\n\n \n\nname \nHTML 4 only, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 Define a names for the clickable area so that it can be scripted by older browsers.\n\n \n\nmedia \nHTML5 A hint of the media for which the linked resource was designed, for example print and screen. If omitted, it defaults to all. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.\n\n \n\nnohref \nHTML 4 only, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 Indicates that no hyperlink exists for the associated area. Either this attribute or the href attribute must be present in the element.  Usage note: This attribute is obsolete in HTML5, instead omitting the href attribute is sufficient.  \n\n \n\nrel \nHTML5 For anchors containing the href attribute, this attribute specifies the relationship of the target object to the link object. The value is a comma-separated list of relationship values. The values and their semantics will be registered by some authority that might have meaning to the document author. The default relationship, if no other is given, is void. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present. \n\nshape The shape of the associated hot spot. The specifications for HTML 5 and HTML 4 define the values rect, which defines a rectangular region; circle, which defines a circular region; poly, which defines a polygon; and default, which indicates the entire region beyond any defined shapes. Many browsers, notably Internet Explorer 4 and higher, support circ, polygon, and rectangle as valid values for shape; these values are Non-standard     .\n\n \n\ntabindex \nHTML 4 only, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 A numeric value specifying the position of the defined area in the browser tabbing order. This attribute is global in HTML5.\n\n \n\ntarget This attribute specifies where to display the linked resource. In HTML4, this is the name of, or a keyword for, a frame. In HTML5, it is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). The following keywords have special meanings:  _self:&nbsp;Load the response into the same HTML4 frame (or HTML5 browsing context) as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed HTML4 window or HTML5 browsing context. _parent:&nbsp;Load the response into the HMTL4 frameset parent of the current frame or HTML5 parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self. _top: In HTML4: Load the response into the full, original window, canceling all other frames. In HTML5: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.  Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.&nbsp; \n\ntype This attribute specifies the media type in the form of a MIME type for the link target. Generally, this is provided strictly as advisory information; however, in the future a browser might add a small icon for multimedia types. For example, a browser might add a small speaker icon when type is set to audio\/wav. For a complete list of recognized MIME types, see http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html4\/references.html#ref-MIMETYPES. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.\n\nExample\n\r\n          &lt;map name=&quot;primary&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;area shape=&quot;circle&quot; coords=&quot;200,250,25&quot; href=&quot;another.htm&quot; \/&gt; \n  &lt;area shape=&quot;default&quot; nohref \/&gt;\n&lt;\/map&gt;\r\n        \nDOM&nbsp;Interface\nThis element implements the HTMLAreaElement interface.\nNotes\nUnder the HTML 3.2, 4.0, and 5 specifications, the closing tag &lt;\/area&gt; is forbidden.\nThe XHTML 1.0 specification requires a trailing slash: &lt;area \/&gt;.\nThe id, class, and style attributes have the same meaning as the core attributes defined in the HTML 4 specification, but only Netscape and Microsoft define them.\nNetscape 1&ndash;level browsers do not understand the target attribute as it relates to frames.\nHTML 3.2 defines only alt, coords, href, nohref, and shape.\n\n   HTML Elements   A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z   (Quick Links: HTML Category)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en\/HTML\/Element\/article","title":"article","description":"Summary\nThe HTML Article Element (&lt;article&gt;) represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, e.g., in syndication.

This continues until the media cache is full, or the entire audio file has been downloaded, whichever comes first. This should only be used when it is expected that the user will choose to play the audio; for example, if the user has navigated to a page using a &quot;Play this audio&quot; link. This attribute was removed in Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 \/ Thunderbird 3.3 \/ SeaMonkey 2.1)\n in favor of the preload attribute. \n\nbuffered An attribute you can read to determine which time ranges of the media have been buffered. This attribute contains a TimeRanges\n object. \n\ncontrols If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control audio playback, including volume, seeking, and pause\/resume playback. \n\nloop A Boolean attribute; if specified, we will, upon reaching the end of the audio, automatically seek back to the start. \n\nmozCurrentSampleOffset \nRequires Gecko 2.0\n Non-standard      The offset, specified as the number of samples since the beginning of the audio stream, at which the audio is currently playing. \n\npreload This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user experience. It may have one of the following values:  none: hints that either the author thinks that the user won't need to consult that video or that the server wants to minimize its traffic; in others terms this hint indicates that the video should not be cached; metadata: hints that though the author thinks that the user won't need to consult that video, fetching the metadata (e.g. length) is reasonable; auto: hints that the user needs have priority; in others terms this hint indicated that, if needed, the whole video could be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it; the empty string: which is a synonym of the auto value.  If not set, its default value is browser-defined (i.e. each browser can choose its own default value), though the spec advises it to be set to metadata. Usage notes:  The autoplay attribute has precedence over this one as if one wants to automatically play a video, the browser will obviously need to download it. Setting both the autoplay and the preload attributes is allowed by the specification. The browser is not forced by the specification to follow the value of this attribute; it is a mere hint.    \n\nsrc The URL of the audio to embed. This is subject to HTTP access controls.

For this purpose, use the &lt;h1&gt;\n to &lt;h6&gt;\n tags. Further, stylesheets can change the default style of these elements, with the result that they are not necessarily&nbsp;displayed in bold. It is a good practice to use the class attribute on the &lt;b&gt; in order to convey additional semantic information (for example &lt;b class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt; for the first sentence in a paragraph). This eases the development of several stylings of a web document, without the need to change its HTML&nbsp;code. Historically, the &lt;b&gt; element was meant to make text boldface.

Normative document HTML5, section 4.10.8 (HTML4.01, section 17.5)  \n\nAttributes\nLike all other HTML elements, this element supports the global attributes.\n \n\nautofocus\nHTML5 This Boolean attribute lets you specify that the button should have input focus when the page loads, unless the user overrides it, for example by typing in a different control. Only one form-associated element in a document can have this attribute specified. \n\ndisabled This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot interact with the button. If this attribute is not specified, the button inherits its setting from the containing element, for example &lt;fieldset&gt;\n; if there is no containing element with the disabled attribute set, then the button is enabled. \n\nform\nHTML5 The form element that the button is associated with (its form owner). The value of the attribute must be the id attribute of a &lt;form&gt;\n element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified, the &lt;button&gt; element must be a descendant of a form element. This attribute enables you to place &lt;button&gt; elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their &lt;form&gt;\n elements. \n\nformaction\nHTML5 The URI&nbsp;of a program that processes the information submitted by the button. If specified, it overrides the \n\naction\n attribute of the button's form owner. \n\nformenctype\nHTML5 If the button is a submit button, this attribute specifies the type of content that is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:  application\/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value if the attribute is not specified. multipart\/form-data: Use this value if you are using an &lt;input&gt;\n element with the \n\ntype\n attribute set to file. text\/plain  If this attribute is specified, it overrides the \n\nenctype\n attribute of the button's form owner.  \n\nformmethod\nHTML5 If the button is a submit button, this attribute specifies the HTTP&nbsp;method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are:  post: The data from the form is included in the body of the form and is sent to the server. get: The data from the form are appended to the form attribute URI, with a '?' as a separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method when the form has no side-effects and contains only ASCII&nbsp;characters.  If specified, this attribute overrides the \n\nmethod\n attribute of the button's form owner.  \n\nformnovalidate\nHTML5 If the button is a submit button, this Boolean attribute specifies that the form is not to be validated when it is submitted. If this attribute is specified, it overrides the \n\nnovalidate\n attribute of the button's form owner. \n\nformtarget\nHTML5 If the button is a submit button, this attribute is a name or keyword indicating where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. This is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). If this attribute is specified, it overrides the \n\ntarget\n attribute of the button's form owner. The following keywords have special meanings:  _self:&nbsp;Load the response into the same browsing context as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context. _parent:&nbsp;Load the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self. _top: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.   \n\nname The name of the button, which submitted with the form data. \n\ntype The type of the button. Possible values are:  submit:&nbsp;The button submits the form data to the server. This is the default if the attribute is not specified, or if the attribute is dynamically changed to an empty or invalid value. reset:&nbsp;The button resets all the controls to their initial values. button: The button has no default behavior.

Possible values are:  left, aligning the content to the left of the cell center, centering the content in the cell right, aligning the content to the right of the cell justify, inserting spaces into the textual content so that the content is justified in the cell char, aligning the textual content on a special character with a minimal offset, defined by the \n\nchar\n and \n\ncharoff\n attributes \nUnimplemented (see\n\nbug 2212\n)\n.  If this attribute is not set, the left value is assumed. The descendant &lt;col&gt;\n elements may override this value using their own \n\nalign\n attribute. Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (not supported) in the latest standard.  To achieve the same effect as the left, center, right or justify values:  Do not try to set the text-align\n property on a selector giving a &lt;colgroup&gt;\n element. Because &lt;td&gt;\n elements are not descendant of the &lt;colgroup&gt;\n element, they won't inherit it. If the table doesn't use a \n\ncolspan\n attribute, use one tr:nth-child(n) CSS selector per column of the colgroup,where n is the ordinal position of this column in the table. Only after this selector the vertical-align\n property can be used. If the table does use a \n\ncolspan\n attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like [colspan=n], though this is not trivial.   To achieve the same effect as the char value, in CSS3, you can use the value of the \n\nchar\n as the value of the text-align\n property \nUnimplemented\n.   \n\n \n\nbgcolor Non-standard      This attribute defines the background color of each cell of the columns member of the column group.. It is one of the 6-digit hexadecimal code as defined in sRGB, prefixed by a '#'. One of the sixteen predefined color strings may be used:    &nbsp; black = &quot;#000000&quot; &nbsp; green = &quot;#008000&quot;   &nbsp; silver = &quot;#C0C0C0&quot; &nbsp; lime = &quot;#00FF00&quot;   &nbsp; gray = &quot;#808080&quot; &nbsp; olive = &quot;#808000&quot;   &nbsp; white = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot; &nbsp; yellow = &quot;#FFFF00&quot;   &nbsp; maroon = &quot;#800000&quot; &nbsp; navy = &quot;#000080&quot;   &nbsp; red = &quot;#FF0000&quot; &nbsp; blue = &quot;#0000FF&quot;   &nbsp; purple = &quot;#800080&quot; &nbsp; teal = &quot;#008080&quot;   &nbsp; fuchsia = &quot;#FF00FF&quot; &nbsp; aqua = &quot;#00FFFF&quot;    Usage note:&nbsp;Do not use this attribute, as it is non-standard and only implemented some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer: the &lt;colgroup&gt;\n elements should be styled using CSS. To give a similar effect to the bgcolor attribute, use the CSS property background-color\n on the relevant &lt;td&gt;\n elements. \n\n \n\nchar \n\nDeprecated\n\n in \nHTML 4.01, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 This attribute is used to set the character to align the cells in a column on. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If \n\nalign\n is not set to char, this attribute is ignored, though it will still be used as the default value for the \n\nalign\n of the &lt;col&gt;\n which are members of this column group. Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (and not supported) in the latest standard. To achieve the same effect as the \n\nchar\n, in CSS3, you can use the character set using the \n\nchar\n attribute as the value of the text-align\n property \nUnimplemented\n. \n\n \n\ncharoff \n\nDeprecated\n\n in \nHTML 4.01, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 This attribute is used to indicate the number of characters to offset the column data from the alignment characters specified by the char attribute. Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (and not supported) in the latest standard. \n\n \n\nspan This attribute contains a positive integer indicating the number of additional consecutive columns to apply the attributes of the &lt;column&gt; element. If not present, its default value is 0. Note: This attribute apply on the attributes of the column grup, it has no effect on the CSS styling rules associated to it or, even more, to the cells of the columns members of the group. \n\n \n\nvalign \n\nDeprecated\n\n in \nHTML 4.01, \n\nObsolete in \nHTML5 This attribute specifies the vertical alignment of the text within each cell of the column. Possible values for this attribute are:  baseline, which will put the text as close to the bottom of the cell as it is possible, but align it on the baseline of the characters instead of the bottom of them. If characters are all of the size, this has the same effect as bottom. bottom, which will put the text as close to the bottom of the cell as it is possible; middle, which will center the text in the cell; and top, which will put the text as close to the top of the cell as it is possible.  Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (and not supported) in the latest standard:  Do not try to set the vertical-align\n property on a selector giving a &lt;colgroup&gt;\n element. Because &lt;td&gt;\n elements are not descendant of the &lt;colgroup&gt;\n element, they won't inherit it. If the table doesn't use a \n\ncolspan\n attribute, use the tr:nth-child(n) CSS selector where n is the ordinal position of the column in the table.

In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values, this attribute might take the special form 0*, which means that the width of each column in the group should be the minimum width necessary to hold the column's contents. Relative widths such as 0.5* also can be used.\n\nDOM interface\nThis element implements the HTMLTableColElement interface.\nExamples\nPlease see the &lt;table&gt;\n page for examples on &lt;colgroup&gt;.\nCompatibility\n\n\n\n Desktop Mobile\n\n\n\n   Feature Chrome Firefox (Gecko) Internet Explorer Opera Safari   Basic support 1.0 1.0 (1.7 or earlier)\n (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)   align\/valign attribute ? -- \n\nbug 915\n ? ? ?   char\/charoff attribute ? -- \n\nbug 2212\n ? ? ?   bgcolor attribute ? -- (Supported) ? ?  \n\n\n\n   Feature Android Firefox Mobile (Gecko) IE Mobile Opera Mobile Safari Mobile   Basic support ? 1.0 (1.0)\n ? ? ?   align\/valign attribute ? -- \n\nbug 915\n ? ? ?   char\/charoff attribute ? -- \n\nbug 2212\n ? ? ?   bgcolor attribute ? -- ? ? ?  \n\n\nCompatibility\n\n\n\n Desktop Mobile\n\n\n\n   Feature Chrome Firefox (Gecko) Internet Explorer Opera Safari   Basic support 1.0 1.0 (1.7 or earlier)\n (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)   align\/valign attribute ? -- \n\nbug 915\n ? ? ?   char\/charoff attribute ? -- \n\nbug 2212\n ? ? ?   bgcolor attribute ? -- (Supported) ? ?  \n\n\n\n   Feature Android Firefox Mobile (Gecko) IE Mobile Opera Mobile Safari Mobile   Basic support ? 1.0 (1.0)\n ? ? ?   align\/valign attribute ? -- \n\nbug 915\n ? ? ?   char\/charoff attribute ? -- \n\nbug 2212\n ? ? ?   bgcolor attribute ? -- ? ? ?  \n\n\nSee also\n Other table-related HTML&nbsp;Elements: &lt;caption&gt;\n, &lt;col&gt;\n, &lt;table&gt;\n, &lt;tbody&gt;\n, &lt;td&gt;\n, &lt;tfoot&gt;\n, &lt;th&gt;\n, &lt;thead&gt;\n, &lt;tr&gt;\n; CSS properties and pseudo-classes that may be specially useful to style the &lt;col&gt; element:&nbsp;  the width\n property to control the width of the column; the :nth-child\n pseudo-class to set the alignment on the cells of the column; the text-align\n property to align all cells content on the same character, like '.'.  \n"},{"url":"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en\/HTML\/Element\/del","title":"del","description":"Summary\nThe Deleted Text (&lt;del&gt;) HTML&nbsp;element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document.

Italics and emphasis are perhaps one of the most common. Why use &lt;em&gt;&lt;\/em&gt; vs &lt;i&gt;&lt;\/i&gt;? They produce exactly the same result right?\nNot exactly: emphasis is a logical state, and italics is a physical state. Logical states separate presentation from the content, and by doing so allows for it to be expressed in many different ways, perhaps instead of rendering some text as italics you want to render it red, or a different size, or underlined, or even bold. It makes more sense to change the presentational properties for &lt;em&gt; than it does for italics. This is because italics is a physical state; there is no separation of presentation and content, making italics do anything other than italicize text would be confusing and illogical.\nBrowser compatibility\n\n\n\n Desktop Mobile\n\n\n\n   Feature Chrome Firefox (Gecko) Internet Explorer Opera Safari (WebKit)   Basic support 1.0 (Supported) (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)  \n\n\n\n   Feature Android Firefox Mobile (Gecko) IE&nbsp;Phone Opera Mobile Safari Mobile   Basic support (Supported) (Supported) (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)  \n\n\nSee also\n &lt;i&gt;\n\n\n\n   HTML Elements   A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z   (Quick Links: HTML Category)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowser compatibility\n\n\n\n Desktop Mobile\n\n\n\n   Feature Chrome Firefox (Gecko) Internet Explorer Opera Safari (WebKit)   Basic support 1.0 (Supported) (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)  \n\n\n\n   Feature Android Firefox Mobile (Gecko) IE&nbsp;Phone Opera Mobile Safari Mobile   Basic support (Supported) (Supported) (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)  \n\n\nSee also\n &lt;i&gt;\n\n\n\n   HTML Elements   A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z   (Quick Links: HTML Category)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en\/HTML\/Element\/embed","title":"embed","description":"Summary\nThe HTML&nbsp;Embed Element (&lt;embed&gt;) represents an integration point for an external application or interactive content (in other words, a plug-in).\nUsage context\n   Permitted content None; this is a void element.

Usage note: This attribute has been removed in HTML5 and should no longer be used. Instead, use the accept attribute of the specific &lt;input&gt;\n element.   \n\naccept-charset A list of character encodings that the server accepts. The list can be delimited by spaces or commas. The browser uses in the order in which they are listed. The default value is the reserved string &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;, in which case the encoding corresponds to the encoding of the document containing the form element. HTML 4: In previous versions of HTML, the different character encodings could be delimited by spaces or commas. This is no longer the case in HTML5, where only spaces are correct.  \n\naction The URI of a program that processes the information submitted via the form. This value can be overridden by a \n\nformaction\n attribute on a &lt;button&gt;\n or &lt;input&gt;\n element. \n\nautocomplete \nHTML5 Indicates whether controls in this form can by default have their values automatically completed by the browser. This setting can be overridden by an autocomplete attribute on an element belonging to the form. Possible values are:  off: The user must explicitly enter a value into each field for every use, or the document provides its own auto-completion method; the browser does not automatically complete entries. on: The browser can automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered during previous uses of the form.   Note: If you set autocomplete to off in a form because the document provides its own auto-completion, then you should also set autocomplete to off for each of the form's input elements that the document can auto-complete. For details, see Google Chrome notes.   \n\nenctype When the value of the method attribute is post, this attribute is the MIME&nbsp;type of content that is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:  application\/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value if the attribute is not specified. multipart\/form-data: Use this value if you are using an &lt;input&gt;\n element with the type attribute set to &quot;file&quot;. text\/plain (HTML5)  This value can be overridden by a \n\nformenctype\n attribute on a &lt;button&gt;\n or &lt;input&gt;\n element.  \n\nmethod The HTTP&nbsp;method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are:  post: Corresponds to the HTTP POST&nbsp;method ; the data from the form is included in the body of the form and is sent to the server. get: Corresponds to the HTTP GET method; the data from the form are appended to the action attribute URI, with a '?' as a separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method when the form has no side-effects and contains only ASCII&nbsp;characters.  This value can be overridden by a \n\nformmethod\n attribute on a &lt;button&gt;\n or &lt;input&gt;\n element.  \n\nname The name of the form. In HTML 4 its use is deprecated (id should be used instead). It must be unique among the forms in a document and not the empty string in HTML 5. \n\nnovalidate \nHTML5 This Boolean attribute indicates that the form is not to be validated when it is submitted. If this attribute is missing (and therefore the form is validated), this default setting can be overridden by a \n\nformnovalidate\n attribute on a &lt;button&gt;\n or &lt;input&gt;\n element belonging to the form. \n\ntarget A name or keyword indicating where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. In HTML 4, this is the name of, or a keyword for, a frame. In HTML5, it is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). The following keywords have special meanings:  _self:&nbsp;Load the response into the same HTML 4 frame (or HTML5 browsing context) as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed HTML 4 window or HTML5 browsing context. _parent:&nbsp;Load the response into the HTML 4 frameset parent of the current frame or HTML5 parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self. _top: HTML 4: Load the response into the full, original window, canceling all other frames.&nbsp; HTML5: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.

The form owner is either the form element that this &lt;input&gt; element is a descendant of or the form element whose id is specified by the form attribute of the input element. For more information, see the autocomplete attribute in &lt;form&gt;\n.  \n\nautofocus \nHTML5 This Boolean attribute lets you specify that a form control should have input focus when the page loads, unless the user overrides it, for example by typing in a different control. Only one form element in a document can have the autofocus attribute, which is a Boolean. It cannot be applied if the type attribute is set to hidden (that is, you cannot automatically set focus to a hidden control). \n\nchecked When the value of the type attribute is radio or checkbox, the presence of this Boolean attribute indicates that the control is selected by default; otherwise it is ignored. \n\ndisabled This Boolean attribute indicates that the form control is not available for interaction. In particular, the click event will not be dispatched on disabled controls. This attribute is ignored if the value of the type attribute is hidden.  \n\nform \nHTML5 The form element that the input element is associated with (its form owner). The value of the attribute must be an id of a &lt;form&gt;\n element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified, this &lt;input&gt; element must be a descendant of a &lt;form&gt;\n element. This attribute enables you to place &lt;input&gt; elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their form elements. \n\nformaction\nHTML5 The URI&nbsp;of a program that processes the information submitted by the input element, if it is a submit button or image. If specified, it overrides the \n\naction\n attribute of the element's form owner. \n\nformenctype\nHTML5 If the input element is a submit button or image, this attribute specifies the type of content that is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:  application\/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value if the attribute is not specified. multipart\/form-data: Use this value if you are using an &lt;input&gt;\n element with the \n\ntype\n attribute set to file. text\/plain  If this attribute is specified, it overrides the \n\nenctype\n attribute of the element's form owner.  \n\nformmethod\nHTML5 If the input element is a submit button or image, this attribute specifies the HTTP&nbsp;method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are:  post: The data from the form is included in the body of the form and is sent to the server. get: The data from the form are appended to the form attribute URI, with a '?' as a separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method when the form has no side-effects and contains only ASCII&nbsp;characters.  If specified, this attribute overrides the \n\nmethod\n attribute of the element's form owner.  \n\nformnovalidate\nHTML5 If the input element is a submit button or image, this Boolean attribute specifies that the form is not to be validated when it is submitted. If this attribute is specified, it overrides the \n\nnovalidate\n attribute of the element's form owner. \n\nformtarget\nHTML5 If the input element is a submit button or image, this attribute is a name or keyword indicating where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. This is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). If this attribute is specified, it overrides the \n\ntarget\n attribute of the elements's form owner. The following keywords have special meanings:  _self:&nbsp;Load the response into the same browsing context as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context. _parent:&nbsp;Load the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self. _top: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.   \n\nheight \nHTML5 &nbsp;If the value of the type attribute is image, this attribute defines the height of the image displayed for the button. \n\nlist \nHTML5 Identifies a list of pre-defined options to suggest to the user. The value must be the id of a &lt;datalist&gt;\n element in the same document. The browser displays only options that are valid values for this input element. This attribute is ignored when the type attribute's value is hidden, checkbox, radio, file, or a button type. \n\nmax \nHTML5&nbsp; The maximum (numeric or date-time) value for this item, which must not be less than its minimum (min attribute) value. \n\nmaxlength \nHTML5 If the value of the type attribute is text,&nbsp;email,&nbsp;search, password, tel, or url,&nbsp; this attribute specifies the maximum number of characters (in Unicode code points) that the user can enter; for other control types, it is ignored. It can exceed the value of the size attribute. If it is not specified, the user can enter an unlimited number of characters. Specifying a negative number results in the default behavior; that is, the user can enter an unlimited number of characters. The constraint is evaluated only when the value of the attribute has been changed. \n\nmin \nHTML5&nbsp; The minimum (numeric or date-time) value for this item, which must not be greater than its maximum (max attribute) value. \n\nmultiple\nHTML5 This Boolean attribute indicates whether the user can enter more than one value. This attribute applies when the type attribute is set to email or file; otherwise it is ignored. \n\nname The name of the control, which is submitted with the form data. \n\npattern\nHTML5 A regular expression that the control's value is checked against. The pattern must match the entire value, not just some subset. Use the title attribute to describe the pattern to help the user. This attribute applies when the value of the type attribute is text, search, tel, url or email; otherwise it is ignored. \n\nplaceholder \nHTML5 A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control . The placeholder text must not contain carriage returns or line-feeds. This attribute applies when the value of the type attribute is text, search, tel, url or email; otherwise it is ignored. \n\nreadonly This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot modify the value of the control. \nHTML5 This attribute is ignored if the value of the type attribute is hidden, range, color, checkbox, radio, file, or a button type.  \n\nrequired \nHTML5 This attribute specifies that the user must fill in a value before submitting a form. It cannot be used when the type attribute is hidden, image, or a button type (submit, reset, or button). The :optional\n and :required\n CSS pseudo-classes will be applied to the field as appropriate. \n\nselectionDirection \nHTML5 The direction in which selection occurred. This is &quot;forward&quot; if the selection was made from left-to-right in an LTR locale or right-to-left in an RTL&nbsp;locale, or &quot;backward&quot; if the selection was made in the opposite direction. This can be &quot;none&quot;&nbsp;if the selection direction is unknown. \n\nsize The initial size of the control. This value is in pixels unless the value of the type attribute is text or password, in which case, it is an integer number of characters. Starting in HTML5, this attribute applies only when the type attribute is set to text, search, tel, url, email, or password; otherwise it is ignored. In addition, the size must be greater than zero. If you don't specify a size, a default value of 20 is used. \n\nsrc If the value of the type attribute is image, this attribute specifies a URI for the location of an image to display on the graphical submit button; otherwise it is ignored. \n\nstep \nHTML5 Works with the min and max attributes to limit the increments at which a numeric or date-time value can be set. It can be the string any or a positive floating point number. If this attribute is not set to any, the control accepts only values at multiples of the step value greater than the minimum. \n\ntabindex element-specific in \nHTML 4, global in \nHTML5 The position of the element in the tabbing navigation order for the current document. \n\nusemap&nbsp;\nHTML 4 only, \nObsolete since HTML5 The name of a &lt;map&gt;\n&nbsp;element to as an image map. \n\nvalue The initial value of the control. This attribute is optional except when the value of the type attribute is radio or checkbox. Note that when reloading the page, Gecko and IE will ignore the value specified in the HTML source, if the value was changed before the reload. \n\nwidth \nHTML5 &nbsp;If the value of the type attribute is image, this attribute defines the width of the image displayed for the button. \n\nx-moz-errormessage Non-standard      This Mozilla extension allows you to specify the error message to display when a field doesn't successfully validate.\n\n Notes\nFile inputs\n \nGecko 2.0 note(Firefox 4 \/ Thunderbird 3.3 \/ SeaMonkey 2.1)\n\n Starting in&nbsp;Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 \/ Thunderbird 3.3 \/ SeaMonkey 2.1)\n, calling the click() method on an &lt;input&gt;\n element of type file opens the file picker and lets the user select files.

That is, you may specify keyparams=&quot;pqg-params&quot; or pqg=&quot;pqg-params&quot;.\nFor RSA keys, the keyparams parameter is not used (ignored if present). The user may be given a choice of RSA key strengths. Currently, the user is given a choice between &quot;high&quot; strength (2048 bits) and &quot;medium&quot; strength (1024 bits).\nFor DSA keys, the keyparams parameter specifies the DSA PQG parameters which are to be used in the keygen process. The value of the pqg parameter is the the BASE64 encoded, DER encoded Dss-Parms as specified in IETF RFC 3279. The user may be given a choice of DSA key sizes, allowing the user to choose one of the sizes defined in the DSA standard.\nFor EC keys, the keyparams parameter specifies the name of the elliptic curve on which the key will be generated. It is normally a string from the table in nsKeygenHandler.cpp. (Note that only a subset of the curves named there may actually be supported in any particular browser.) If the keyparams parameter string is not a recognized curve name string, then a curve is chosen according to the user's chosen key strength (low, medium, high), using the curve named &quot;secp384r1&quot; for high, and the curve named &quot;secp256r1&quot; for medium keys. (Note: choice of the number of key strengths, default values for each strength, and the UI by which the user is offered a choice, are outside of the scope of this specification.)\nThe keygen element is only valid within an HTML form. It will cause some sort of selection to be presented to the user for selecting key size. The UI for the selection may be a menu, radio buttons, or possibly something else. The browser presents several possible key strengths. Currently, two strengths are offered, high and medium. If the user's browser is configured to support cryptographic hardware (e.g. &quot;smart cards&quot;) the user may also be given a choice of where to generate the key, i.e., in a smart card or in software and stored on disk.\nWhen the submit button is pressed, a key pair of the selected size is generated.

The value of the attribute must be an id of a &lt;form&gt;\n element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified, this element must be a descendant of a &lt;form&gt;\n element. This attribute enables you to place &lt;keygen&gt; elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their form elements. \n\nkeytype The type of key generated.

The value is a space- and\/or comma-delimited list of character sets as defined in RFC 2045. The default value is ISO-8859-1. Usage note: This attribute is obsolete in HTML5 and must not be used by authors. To achieve its effect, use the Content-Type: HTTP header on the linked resource. \n\n \n\ndisabled Non-standard      This attribute is used to disable a link relationship. In conjunction with scripting, this attribute could be used to turn on and off various style sheet relationships. Usage note: This attribute is non-standard and only used by some Microsoft browsers. Do not use it. To achieve its effect, use one of the following techniques: &nbsp;  If the disabled attribute has been added directly to the page, do not include the &lt;link&gt;\n element instead; If the disabled attribute has been added via scripting, remove the element from the DOM&nbsp;via scripting.   \n\n \n\nhref This attribute specifies the URL of the linked resource. A URL might be absolute or relative.\n\n \n\nhreflang This attribute indicates the language of the linked resource. It is purely advisory. Allowed values are determined by BCP47 for HTML5 and by RFC1766 for HTML 4. Use this attribute only if the \n\nhref\n attribute is present.\n\n \n\nmedia This attribute specifies the media which the linked resource applies to. Its value must be a media query. This attribute is mainly useful when linking to external stylesheets by allowing the user agent to pick the best adapted one for the device it runs on. Usage note:&nbsp; &nbsp;  In HTML 4, this can only be a simple white-space-separated list of media description literals, i.e., media types and groups, where defined and allowed as values for this attribute, such as print, screen, aural, braille. HTML5 extended this to any kind of media queries, which are a superset of the allowed values of HTML 4. Browsers not supporting the CSS3 Media Queries won't necessary recognized the adequate link; do not forget to set fallback links,&nbsp; the restricted set of media queries defined in HTML 4.   \n\n \n\nmethods Non-standard      The value of this attribute provides information about the functions that might be performed on an object. The values generally are given by the HTTP protocol when it is used, but it might (for similar reasons as for the title attribute) be useful to include advisory information in advance in the link. For example, the browser might choose a different rendering of a link as a function of the methods specified; something that is searchable might get a different icon, or an outside link might render with an indication of leaving the current site. This attribute is not well understood nor supported, even by the defining browser, Internet Explorer 4. See Methods Property (MSDN). \n\nrel This attribute names a relationship of the linked document to the current document. The attribute must be a space-separated list of the link types values. The most common use of this attribute is to specify a link to an external style sheet:&nbsp;the rel attribute is set to stylesheet, and the href attribute is set to the URL of an external style sheet to format the page. WebTV also supports the use of the value next for rel to preload the next page in a document series.\n\n \n\nrev\n\nObsolete The value of this attribute shows the relationship of the current document to the linked document, as defined by the \n\nhref\n attribute. The attribute thus defines the reverse relationship compared to the value of the rel attribute. Link types values for the attribute are similar to the possible values for \n\nrel\n. Usage note: This attribute is obsolete in HTML5. Do not use it. To achieve its effect, use the \n\nrel\n attribute with the opposite link types values, e.g. made should be replaced by author. Also this attribute doesn't mean revision and must not be used with a version number, which is unfortunately the case on numerous sites. \n\n \n\nsizes \nHTML5 This attribute defines the sizes of the icons for visual media contained in the resource. It must be present only if the \n\nrel\n contains the icon link types value. It may have the following values:  any, meaning that the icon can be scaled to any size as it is in a vectorial format, like image\/svg. a white-space separated list of sizes, each in the format &lt;width in pixels&gt;x&lt;height in pixels&gt; or &lt;width in pixels&gt;X&lt;height in pixels&gt;. Each of these sizes must be contained in the resource.  Usage note:&nbsp; &nbsp;  Most icon format are only able to store one single icon; therefore most of the time the \n\nsizes\n contains only one entry. Among the major browsers, only the Apple's ICNS format allows the storage of multiple icons, and this format is only supported in WebKit. Apple's iOS does not support this attribute, hence Apple's iPhone and iPad use special, non-standard link types values to define icon to be used as Web Clip or start-up placeholder: apple-touch-icon and apple-touch-startup-icon.   \n\n \n\ntargetNon-standard      Defines the frame or window name that has the defined linking relationship or that will show the rendering of any linked resource.\n\n \n\ntype This attribute is used to define the type of the content linked to. The value of the attribute should be a MIME type such as text\/html, text\/css, and so on. The common use of this attribute is to define the type of style sheet linked and the most common current value is text\/css, which indicates a Cascading Style Sheet format.\n\nDOM interface\nThis element implements the HTMLLinkElement interface.\nExamples\nIncluding a stylesheet\nTo include a stylesheet in a page, use the following syntax:\n\r\n          &lt;link href=&quot;style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text\/css&quot; media=&quot;all&quot;&gt;\r\n        \nProviding alternative stylesheets\nYou can also specify alternative style sheets.\nThe user can choose which style sheet to use by choosing it from the View&gt;Page Style menu.

HTML 3.2 defines only the href, rel, rev, and title attributes for the link element. HTML 2 defines the href, methods, rel, rev, title, and urn attributes for the &lt;link&gt; element.

It can be locally overridden using the lang attribute on any element. This attribute is a literal string and must be one of the preferred MIME name for a character encoding as defined by the IANA. Though the standard doesn't request a specific character encoding, it gives some recommendations about it:  Authors are encouraged to use UTF-8. Authors should not use ASCII-incompatible encodings (i.e. those that don't map the 8-bit code points 0x20 to 0x7E to the Unicode 0x0020 to 0x007E code points) as these represent a security risk: browsers non supporting them may interpret benign content as HTML&nbsp;Elements. This is the case of at least the following charsets: JIS_C6226-1983, JIS_X0212-1990, HZ-GB-2312, JOHAB, the ISO-2022 family, and the EBCDIC family. Authors must not use CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1 and SCSU, also falling in that category and not intended to be used on the web. Cross-scripting attacks with some of these encodings have been documented. Authors should not use UTF-32 as not all HTML 5 encoding algorithm can distinguish it from UTF-16.  Notes:  The declared character set must match the one of the page. It is pointless, and will lead to a poor user experience, to declare an erroneous character set. This &lt;meta&gt;\n element must be inside the &lt;head&gt;\n element and within the 512 first bytes of the page, as some browsers only look at these first bytes before choosing a character set for the page. This &lt;meta&gt;\n element is only a part of the algorithm to determine the character set of a page that browsers apply. Especially, the HTTP&nbsp;Content-Type header and any BOM&nbsp;elements have precedence over this element. It is good practice, and strongly recommended, to define the character set using this attribute. If no character set is defined for a page, several cross-scripting techniques may become practical to harm the page user, like the UTF-7&nbsp;fallback cross-scripting technique. Always setting this meta will protect against these risks. This &lt;meta&gt;\n element is a synonym for the pre-HTML5 &lt;meta&nbsp;http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text\/html;&nbsp;charset=IANAcharset&quot;&gt; where IANAcharset corresponds of the value of the equivalent \n\ncharset\n attribute. This syntax is still allowed, although obsolete and no more recommended.    \n\ncontent This attribute gives the value associated with the \n\nhttp-equiv\n or \n\nname\n attribute, depending of the context. \n\nhttp-equiv This enumerated attribute defines the pragma that can alter servers and user-agents behavior. The value of the pragma is defined using the \n\ncontent\n and can be one of the following:  content-language \n\nObsolete This pragma defines the default language of the page. Usage note: do not use this pragma, as it is no more recommended. Use the global lang attribute on the &lt;body&gt;\n element instead.  content-type \n\nObsolete This attribute defines the MIME type of the document, eventually followed by its character set. It follows the same syntax as the HTTP content-type entity-header field, but as it is inside an HTML&nbsp;Element, most value are not possible. Therefore the valid syntax for its content is the literal string 'text\/html' eventually followed by a character set with the following syntax:&nbsp;'; charset=IANAcharset' where IANAcharset is the preferred MIME name for a character set as defined by the IANA Usage note:  Do not use this pragma, as it is no more recommended. Use the \n\ncharset\n attribute on the &lt;meta&gt;\n element instead. As the &lt;meta&gt;\n may not be used to change the type of a document in an XHTML document, or in an HTML5 document following the XHTML syntax, never set set MIME&nbsp;type to an XHTML MIME type that way. It would be incorrect. Only HTML document can use the content-type, so most of it is redundant: that's why it has been obsoleted and replaset by the \n\ncharset\n attribute.    default-style This pragma specifies the preferred stylesheet to be used on the page. The \n\ncontent\n attribute must contains the id of a &lt;link&gt;\n element whose \n\nhref\n attribute links to a CSS stylesheet, or the id of a &lt;style&gt;\n element which contains a CSS stylesheet. refresh This pragma specifies:  the number of seconds until the page should be reloaded, if the \n\ncontent\n attribute contains only a positive integer number; the number of seconds until the page should be redirected to another, if the \n\ncontent\n attribute contains a positive integer number followed by the string ';url=' and a valid URL.   set-cookie \n\nObsolete This pragma defines a cookie for the page. Its content must follows the syntax defines in the IETF HTTP&nbsp;Cookie Specification. Note: Do not use this pragma as it is obsolete. Use the HTTP header set-cookie instead.    \n\nname This attribute defines the name of a document-level metadata. It should not be set if one of the attribute \n\nitemprop\n, \n\nhttp-equiv\n or \n\ncharset\n is also set. This document-level metadata name is associated with a value, contained by the \n\ncontent\n attribute. The possible values for the name element are, with their associated value stored via the \n\ncontent\n attribute:  application-name, defining the name of the web application running in the webpage; Note:  browsers may use this to identify the application. It is different from the &lt;title&gt;\n element, which usually consist of&nbsp; the application name but may also contain specific information like the document name or a status; simple webpages shouldn't defines the application-name meta.    author, defining, in a free format, the name of the author of the document; description, containing a short and accurate summary of the content of the page. Several browsers, among them Firefox and Opera, use this meta as the default description of the page when bookmarked; generator, containing, in a free format, the identifier to the software that generated the page; keywords, containing, as strings separated by commas, relevant words associated with the content of the page.  The attribute may also have a value taken from the extended list defined on WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page. Also none has been formally accepted yet, a few commonly used names are among the proposals:  creator, defining, in a free format, the name of the creator of the document. Note that it can be the name of the institution. If there are more than one, several &lt;meta&gt;\n element should be used; googlebot, which is a synonym of robots, but is only followed by Googlebot, the indexing crawler for Google; publisher, defining, in a free format, the name of the publisher of the document. Note that it can be the name of the institution; robots, defining the behavior that cooperative crawlers should have with the page. It is a comma-separated list of values taken in the following list:  Values for the content of &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot;&gt;   Value Description Used by     index Allows the robot to index the page All   noindex Prevents the robot to index the page All   follow Allows the robot to follow the links on the page All   nofollow Prevents the robot to follow the links on the page All   noodp Prevents the usage of the Open Directory Project description, if any, as the description of the page in the search engine results page  Google, Yahoo, Bing    noarchive Prevents the search engine to cache the content of the page Google, Yahoo   nosnippet Prevents the display of any description of the page in the search engine results page Google   noimageindex Prevents this page to appear as the referring page of an indexed image Google   noydir Prevents the usage of the Yahoo Directory description, if any, as the description of the page in the search engine results page Yahoo   nocache Synonym of noarchive Bing    Notes:  Only cooperative robots will follow the rules defined by the robots name. Do not expect to keep e-mail harvesters at bay with this The robot still needs to access the page in order to read the meta value. If you want to keep them at bay, for example to prevent bandwidth consumption, use a robots.txt file instead (or in complement). If you want to remove the page of an index, changing the meta to noindex will work, but only when the robot visit the page again. Be sure not to prevent such visit, via the robots.txt file for example. Some search engines have developers tools allowing a quick removal of some page. Some possible values are mutually exclusive, like using index and noindex, or follow and nofollow, at the same time. In these case the behavior of the robot is undefined, and may vary from one to the other. So avoid these cases. Some search engine crawler robots, like those of Google, Yahoo&nbsp;Search or Bing, supports the same values on an HTTP directive, X-Robot-Tags: this allows to use these pragma on non-HTML documents, like images.    slurp, which is a synonym of robots, but is only followed by Slurp, the indexing crawler for Yahoo Search;  Finally a few names are in common use, though not in progress of being standardized:  viewport, which gives hints about the size of the initial size of the viewport. This pragma is used by several mobile devices only.  Values for the content of &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot;&gt;   Value Possible values Description     width a positive integer number or the literal device-width defines the width, in pixels, of the viewport   heigth a positive integer number of the literal device-height defines the height, in pixels, of the viewport   initial-scale a positive number between 0.0 and 10.0 defines the ratio between the device width (device-width in portrait mode or device-height in landscape mode) and the viewport size.e   maximum-scale a positive number between 0.0 and 10.0 defines the maximum value of the zoom; it must be greater or equal to the minimum-scale or the behavior is underterminate.   minimum-scale a positive number between 0.0 and 10.0 defines the minimum value of the zoom; it must be smaller or equal to the maximum-scale or the behavior is undeterminate.   user-scalable a boolean value (yes or no) If set to no, the user is not able to zoom or in the webpage. Default value is yes.    Notes:  Though not standardized, this attribute is used by different mobile browsers like Safari Mobile, Firefox for Mobile or Opera Mobile. The default values may change from one device, and browser, to another To learn about this pragma in Firefox for Mobile, see&nbsp;this article.      \n\nscheme \n\nObsolete This attribute defines the scheme in which the metadata is described. A scheme is a context leading to the correct interpretations of the \n\ncontent\n value, like a format.  Notes: Do not use this attribute as it has been deprecated. There is no replacement for it as there was no real usage for it. Omit it altogether. \n\nDOM&nbsp;interface\nThis element implements the HTMLMetaElement interface.\nExamples\n\r\n          &lt;!-- Defining the charset in HTML4 --&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text\/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- In HTML5 --&gt;\n&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Redirect page after 3 seconds --&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;3;url=http:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/&quot;&gt;\r\n        \nSee also\n The other elements containing metadata: &lt;base&gt;\n, &lt;head&gt;\n, &lt;link&gt;\n, &lt;style&gt;\n,&lt;title&gt;\n.\n"},{"url":"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en\/HTML\/Element\/meter","title":"meter","description":"Summary\nThe HTML meter element (&lt;meter&gt;) represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.\nUsage note: Unless the value attribute is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), the min attribute and max attribute should define the range so that the value attribute's value is within it.\nUsage context\n   Content categories flow content, phrasing content, Labelable Form-associated content   Permitted content Phrasing content, but no descendant meter elements.

It has no effect on inline scripts (i.e., scripts that don't have the src attribute). In older browsers that don't support the async attribute, parser-inserted scripts block the parser; script-inserted scripts execute asynchronously in IE and WebKit, but synchronously in Opera and pre-4.0 Firefox. In Firefox 4.0, the async DOM&nbsp;property defaults to true for script-created scripts, so the default behavior matches the behavior of IE&nbsp;and WebKit. To request script-inserted external scripts be executed in the insertion order in browsers where the document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;).async evaluates to true (such as Firefox 4.0), set .async=false on the scripts you want to maintain order. Never call document.write() from an async script. In Gecko 1.9.2, calling document.write() has an unpredictable effect. In Gecko 2.0, calling document.write() from an async script has no effect (other than printing a warning to the error console). \n\nsrc This attribute specifies the URI of an external script; this can be used as an alternative to embedding a script directly within a document. script elements with an src attribute specified should not have a script embedded within its tags. \n\ntype This attribute identifies the scripting language of code embedded within a script element or referenced via the element&rsquo;s src attribute. This is specified as a MIME type; examples of supported MIME types include text\/javascript, text\/ecmascript, application\/javascript, and application\/ecmascript. If this attribute is absent, the script is treated as JavaScript. \n\nlanguage \n\nDeprecated\n\n Like the type attribute, this attribute identifies the scripting language in use. Unlike the type attribute, however, this attribute&rsquo;s possible values were never standardized. The type attribute should be used instead. \n\ndefer This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed. Since this feature hasn't yet been implemented by all other major browsers, authors should not assume that the script&rsquo;s execution will actually be deferred. Never call document.write() from a defer script (since Gecko 1.9.2, this will blow away the document). The defer attribute shouldn't be used on scripts that don't have the src attribute. Since Gecko 1.9.2, the defer attribute is ignored on scripts that don't have the src attribute. However, in Gecko 1.9.1 even inline scripts are deferred if the defer attribute is set.\n\nDOM interface\nThis element implements the HTMLScriptElement interface.\nExamples\n\r\n          &lt;!-- HTML4 and (x)HTML --&gt;\n&lt;script type=&quot;text\/javascript&quot; src=&quot;javascript.js&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- HTML5 --&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;javascript.js&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;\r\n        \nCompatibility\n\n\n\n Desktop Mobile\n\n\n    Feature Chrome Firefox (Gecko) Internet Explorer Opera Safari   Basic support 1.0 1.0 (1.7 or earlier)\n (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)   async attribute (Supported) 3.6 (1.9.2)\n 10 -- (Supported)   defer attribute (Supported) 3.5 (1.9.1)\n 4 -- (Supported)   \n\n    Feature Android Firefox Mobile (Gecko) IE Mobile Opera Mobile Safari Mobile   Basic support (Supported) 1.0 (1.0)\n (Supported) (Supported) (Supported)   async attribute (Supported) 1.0 (1.0)\n -- ?

This attribute contains a TimeRanges\n object. \n\ncontrols If this attribute is present, Gecko will offer controls to allow the user to control video playback, including volume, seeking, and pause\/resume playback. \n\nheight The height of the video's display area, in CSS pixels. \n\nloop A Boolean attribute; if specified, we will, upon reaching the end of the video, automatically seek back to the start. \n\nmuted A Boolean attribute which indicates the default setting of the audio contained in the video. If set, the audio will be initially silenced. Its default value is false, meaning that the audio will be played when the video is played. \n\npreload This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user experience. It may have one of the following values:  none: hints that either the author thinks that the user won't need to consult that video or that the server wants to minimize its traffic; in others terms this hint indicates that the video should not be cached. metadata: hints that though the author thinks that the user won't need to consult that video, fetching the metadata (e.g. length) is reasonable. auto: hints that the user needs have priority; in others terms this hint indicated that, if needed, the whole video could be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it. the empty string: which is a synonym of the auto value.  If not set, its default value is browser-defined (i.e. each browser can choose its own default value), though the spec advises it to be set to metadata. Usage notes:  The autoplay attribute has precedence over this one as if one wants to automatically play a video, the browser will obviously need to download it. Setting both the autoplay and the preload attributes is allowed by the specification. The browser is not forced by the specification to follow the value of this attribute; it is a mere hint.    \n\nposter A URL indicating a poster frame to show until the user plays or seeks. If this attribute isn't specified, nothing is displayed until the first frame is available; then the first frame is displayed as the poster frame. \n\nsrc The URL of the video to embed. This is optional; you may instead use the &lt;source&gt;\n element within the video block to specify the video to embed. \n\nwidth The width of the video's display area, in CSS pixels.\n\nTime offsets are currently specified as a float value representing the number of seconds to offset.\nNote: The time offset value definition has not yet been completed in the HTML&nbsp;5 specification and is subject to change.Examples\n\r\n          &lt;!-- Simple video example --&gt;\n&lt;video src=&quot;videofile.ogg&quot; autoplay poster=&quot;posterimage.jpg&quot;&gt;\n  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, \n  but don't worry, you can &lt;a href=&quot;videofile.ogg&quot;&gt;download it&lt;\/a&gt;\n  and watch it with your favorite video player!\n&lt;\/video&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Video with subtitles --&gt;\n&lt;video src=&quot;foo.ogg&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;track kind=&quot;subtitles&quot; src=&quot;foo.en.vtt&quot; srclang=&quot;en&quot; label=&quot;English&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;track kind=&quot;subtitles&quot; src=&quot;foo.sv.vtt&quot; srclang=&quot;sv&quot; label=&quot;Svenska&quot;&gt;\n&lt;\/video&gt;\r\n        \nThe first example plays a video, starting playback as soon as enough of the video has been received to allow playback without pausing to download more. Until the video starts playing, the image &quot;posterimage.jpg&quot; is displayed in its place.\nThe second example allows the user to choose between different subtitles.\nServer support\nIt's worth re-emphasizing for the time being, that if the MIME types for Theora video are not set on the server, the video may not show or show a gray box containing an X (if JavaScript is enabled).\nYou can fix this problem for the Apache Web Server by adding the extension used by your Theora video files (&quot;.ogm&quot;, &quot;.ogv&quot;, or &quot;.ogg&quot; are the most common ones) to the MIME type &quot;video\/ogg&quot; via the &quot;mime.types&quot; file in &quot;\/etc\/apache&quot; or&nbsp; via the &quot;AddType&quot; configuration directive in httpd.conf.\n\nAddType video\/ogg .ogm\nAddType video\/ogg .ogv\nAddType video\/ogg .ogg\n\nYour web host may provide an easy interface to MIME type configuration changes for new technologies until a global update naturally occurs.\nDOM Interface\nThis element implements the HTMLVideoElement interface.Compatibility\n\n\n\n Desktop Mobile\n\n\n    Feature Chrome Firefox (Gecko) Internet Explorer Opera Safari   Basic support 3.0 3.5 (1.9.1)\n 9.0 10.5 3.1   autoplay attribute 3.0 3.5 (1.9.1)\n 9.0 10.5 3.1   buffered attribute ? 4.0 (2.0)\n ? ? ?   controls attribute 3.0 3.5 (1.9.1)\n 9.0 10.5 3.1   loop attribute 3.0 -- \n\nbug 449157\n 9.0 10.5 3.1 \n muted attribute ? -- ? ? ?   poster attribute 3.0 3.6 (1.9.2)\n 9.0 10.5 3.1   preload attribute 3.0 4.0 (2.0)\n 9.0 Supported under the older name autobuffer 3.1   src attribute 3.0 3.5 (1.9.1)\n 9.0 10.5 3.1   \n\n    Feature Android Firefox Mobile (Gecko) IE Mobile Opera Mobile Safari Mobile   Basic support ? 1.0 (1.0)\n ? ? ?   autoplay attribute ? 1.0 (1.0)\n ? ? ?   buffered attribute ? 4.0 (2.0)\n ? ? ?   controls attribute ? 1.0 (1.0)\n ? ? ?   loop attribute ? -- ? ? ? \n muted attribute ? -- ? ? ?   poster attribute ? 1.0 (1.0)\n ? ? ?   preload attribute ? 4.0 (2.0)\n ? ? ?   src attribute ? 1.0 (1.0)\n ? ? ?   \n\nSee also\n Media formats supported by the audio and video elements audio Using HTML5 audio and video Manipulating video using canvas nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement TinyVid - examples using ogg files in HTML 5.
